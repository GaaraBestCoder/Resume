    <h1>My professional Gaming career</h1>

    <ol><h2> <li>World of Warcraft </h2></li>
        <p>Before WoW, my biggest gaming achievement was qualifying for the 2nd Yu-Gi-oh! Nationals where i dropped out relatively early  </p>
        <p>I dedicated 7 years of my life to become the "best Shaman" Player in the world in the PVP format. <br>I finally achieved that goal during Season 7, which ended up being the peak Era of Wow, by placing Rank 1 in all brackets in Arena and earning the Rank 1 Gladiator title. </p>
        <h2><li>Hearthstone</li></h2>
        <p>Hearthstone is the game where I earned the opportunity to live my dream as a full time professional player after i got picked up by the famous Streamer personality and player "Reynoodle".<br>I got signed by the Organisation "Tempo Storm" and attended many Online and Offline Tournaments under their Banner, while at the same time also beginning my journey as a full time Streamer and content creator. </p>
        <h2><li>Artifact</li></h2>
        <p>like the name suggest: An Artifact. It was a short lived transition and experience, since Valve, the gaming Studio behind the project , had big plans, like a 1 million $ world championship tournament, where none of it came to fruition, caused by poor leadership and bad decision making by Valve.</p>
        <h2><li>Dota Underlords</li></h2> <p>I experienced a sudden resurgence of popularity with the release of Dota Underlords,after the collapse of competitive Hearthstone, which forced me to transition to other Gaming titles to maintain my Status as a professional player and content creator. The Game "died" after just 2 Months, caused by the same bad leadership and poor choices of Valve once again. </p>
        <h2><li>Bloons TD</li></h2>
        <p>I streamed bloons for over a year together with other various Game Titles in hopes of a new Game release that i can focus on and regain my Status.These "niche" Games are simply not popular enough to make a living to justify being a full time content creator. </p>
        <h2><li>Skyweaver</li></h2>
    Currently my focus lies in Web 3 Gaming, the future of Competitive Play and making money with Video Games outside of content creation or competitive play. I am an Ambassador for the most promising Web 3 Game to date, which is Skyweaver, a free to play Card Game with a play to earn aspect with integrated NFTs.
